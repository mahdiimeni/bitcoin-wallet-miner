## üì¶ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-wallet-generator.git
cd bitcoin-wallet-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### requirements.txt
```
pybip39
bitcoin
blockcypher
base58
```

## üíª Usage
```
python wallet_generator.py
```

#### Sample Output
```
--- Generated Seed Phrase ---
olympic wage cousin battle...  # 12 random words

Private Key (hex): 5d8a...f3e1
Bitcoin Address:  1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr
Private Key (WIF): Kx983JD...S2RtHJy
Current Balance:  0.00000000 BTC
```
## üîß Technical Process
Wallet Generation Workflow
1. Mnemonic ‚Üí BIP39 entropy generation
2. Seed ‚Üí PBKDF2 derivation (empty passphrase)
3. Master Key ‚Üí HMAC-SHA512("Bitcoin seed", seed)[:32]
4. Address ‚Üí Legacy P2PKH derivation

#### WIF Conversion
```
def hex_to_wif(hex_key):
    # 1. Add 0x80 prefix
    # 2. Double SHA-256 checksum
    # 3. Base58Check encoding
    return base58.b58encode(...)
```
#### API Implementations
#### Active Method (SDK)
```
from blockcypher import get_address_overview
balance = get_address_overview(address, 'btc')['final_balance']/1e8
```

#### Alternative Method (Preserved in Code)
```
# import requests
# response = requests.get(f"https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main/addrs/{address}/balance")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning
### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Critical Notice ‚ÄºÔ∏è
This software generates REAL BITCOIN PRIVATE KEYS.

#### Never:

- Use generated keys for real funds

- Share generated keys publicly

- Run on internet-connected devices

#### Features:

- Rate limited (1 req/sec)

- Educational use only

- No warranty provided
- Its JUST FOR FUN!

## üîí Why Brute-Force Attacks Are Impractical
### Mathematical Reality:
- Key Space Size: Bitcoin private keys use 256-bit cryptography (2¬≤‚Åµ‚Å∂ possible combinations).

- Comparison: There are ‚âà10‚Å∏‚Å∞ atoms in the observable universe vs 10‚Å∑‚Å∑ possible keys.

### Computational Limits:
- Processing Power: Even with 1 trillion guesses/second, checking 0.0000001% of keys would take ‚âà3.8√ó10‚Åµ‚Å∑ years.

- Energy Cost: Brute-forcing one key would consume more energy than our sun will produce in its lifetime.

### Cryptographic Security:
- Algorithm Strength: SHA-256 and ECDSA remain quantum-resistant and unbroken.

- Address Randomness: Modern wallets use HD derivation (BIP32/BIP44) making pattern detection impossible.

### Practical Reality:
- Success Probability: Lower than randomly finding a specific atom on Earth... twice.

- Economic Incentive: Energy costs would exceed potential rewards by astronomical margins.

This explains why even nation-state attackers avoid brute-force methods against properly generated wallets. Always use strong seed phrases!
